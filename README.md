Financial Stress Testing Python Toolkit
Overview
This GitHub repository contains a Python toolkit for conducting financial stress testing. Stress testing is a critical risk management technique used by financial institutions, regulators, and analysts to assess the resilience of financial models and portfolios under adverse economic conditions. This toolkit provides a set of Python scripts and functions for creating stress testing scenarios, building models, scoring model performance, and generating insights.

Random (for generating random scenarios)
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/financial-stress-testing.git
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy
Features
Scenario Creation: Generate economic scenarios for stress testing, including random scenarios, specific event scenarios (e.g., earthquakes, recessions, wars), and more.

Model Building: Create financial models for stress testing, assign sensitivity values to economic scenarios, and assess model performance.

Scoring: Calculate scores to quantify how well the model performs under different scenarios, allowing for comparisons and risk assessments.

Scenario Customization: Tailor scenarios to simulate specific economic events or conditions relevant to your analysis.

Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine.

Import the toolkit functions into your Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks as needed.

Use the provided functions to create stress testing scenarios, build models, and score model performance.

Customize scenarios and sensitivity values to match your specific use case.

Scenarios
The toolkit includes functions to create various stress testing scenarios:

create_random_scenario(): Generate random economic scenarios for stress testing.

create_severe_earthquake_scenario(): Create scenarios simulating the impact of a severe earthquake.

create_recession_scenario(): Generate scenarios reflecting typical recession conditions.

create_war_scenario(): Create scenarios simulating the economic conditions associated with a war, including variables like "war_severity" to indicate conflict intensity.

Models
Build financial models for stress testing using the provided functions:

create_model(scenarios): Assign sensitivity values to economic scenarios. Customize these values based on your model's characteristics.
Scoring
Evaluate the performance of your financial models under different scenarios:

score_model(model, scenarios): Calculate scores to quantify how well the model responds to and is affected by economic conditions. Higher scores indicate better performance.
